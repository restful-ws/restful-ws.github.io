Decades after its invention, the Web's role our day-to-day 
experience continues to grow.  **REST**, the Web's 
underlying architecture style, is what makes the browsable web, 
the vast world of web and mobile applications,
and the invisible hand of modern automation possible. Despite widespread familiarity with common Web
technologies, REST, as it was conceived by its
originator, is often misunderstood.

For organizations and practitioners using Web concepts
and technologies to enhance their enterprises,
products, and user interactions, **restful.ws** 
offers a guide to REST and Web Semantics to
clarify REST concepts and enrich the outcomes for
web-centric projects.
